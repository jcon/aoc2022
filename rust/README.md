# Advent of Code in Rust

An excuse to remove the rust from my ðŸ¦€ skills.

# Running

```sh
cargo run -p day<N> -- input0 input1 ...
```

For example:

```sh
cargo run -p day1 -- ./inputs/day1.sample.txt
```

# Tests

```sh
cargo test
```

```sh
cargo test -p day<N>
```

# Adding a new day's solution

```sh
cargo new day<N>
```
